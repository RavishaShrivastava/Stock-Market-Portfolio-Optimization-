# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Optimization

Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics.Stock market portfolio optimization involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. Using techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), we can construct an efficient portfolio that relies on the efficient frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between risk and return.

<h2>Hence some conclusions:</h2>

SBI (SBIN.NS) has the highest expected return of 0.341120 and also the highest volatility of 0.286117. This suggests it has the potential for the highest returns, but with greater risk.
HDFC Bank (HDFCBANK.NS) has the lowest expected return of 0.061160 and relatively lower volatility of 0.216157. This indicates a more stable, but less lucrative option compared to others.
ICICI Bank (ICICIBANK.NS) shows a good balance with a higher expected return of 0.273392 and the lowest volatility of 0.201959, making it potentially an attractive option for investors looking for good returns with lower risk.
AXIS Bank (AXISBANK.NS) and KOTAK Bank (KOTAKBANK.NS) have moderate values for both expected return and volatility, but AXISBANK.NS offers a better return-risk trade-off than KOTAKBANK.NS.

In summary, SBIN.NS offers the highest potential return but with higher risk, while ICICIBANK.NS offers a balanced return with the least volatility, making it a potentially safer but profitable choice.
